收集了一些关于邮件的地道用语和表达，以后会继续补充。

## 短句、短语

* Already on dev. Waiting you confirm to deploy to live.

* Basic workflow works, will fix some tiny issus this morning, maybe you can check it in the afternoon.But this only a beta, we still need to take some time to find bugs and refactoring code.

* The backend almost done, but since we don't have the mockup for frontend, current is only a crude table on frontend. Will ask Kai about this.

* We (the whole xx group, 5 persons) have checked both the staging and production sites, and it is just as ok as loading any normal sites. There can be two reasons why it took too long to load.

* FYI, please include xx-dev@company.com which the whole xx group will receive your email when you have any problems with xx sites, for sometimes I might be out of office and not be able to reply you on time, my colleagues can help you as soon as they can.

* Let me know if you are not excepted that 

* I’m looping in Taka in case he has any additional information for this conversation. (loop sb in，把某人拉进圈子)

* If someone has a couple of hours today to do this, it would be a big help. We are trying to sign a couple of important contracts for the company this week so I'd like to have him in as good as a mood as possible.

* i can't figure out this bug in several hours

* from my leaky memory

* If it were me in your situation, blablabh....

* and look to add Excel support at a later date if it is deemed essential.

* Would let you know when I finish this one

* If you have any other questions please feel free to contact me

* I know it’s a hot topic and riding the wave would be really nice, but if we in the article claim it’s an actual implementation of Material Design we’d be straight out lying

* Problems arise, however, if we have circular dependencies. That is, if Store A needs to wait for Store B, and Store B needs to wait for Store A, we could wind up in an endless loop.

* Anyway, you do it how you are most confident!

* 电子邮件正确结尾： "I am looking forward to your reply," "Thank you,"或者"Sincerely"都是给收信人留下好印象的结尾方式。

* Note: I believe I asked you these questions already, but I neglected to take complete notes on this. My apologies for the duplication.

* This blog post illustrates the transition I'm undergoing.

* If it has to happen right now (for example, whether someone’s credit card information is correct), you’ll more than likely have to bite the bullet（咬紧牙关） and process it before the response can go back to the user. Even still（尽管如此）, you should think about the user experience by displaying a message letting them know that you’re processing their information and it may take a little while.

* Using a new browser that never have loaded the staging site. It also might be caused by network problems, do you mind if you check the network and try again?

* I just noticed you haven't yet responded to the Hangouts invitation from xx. Since this call is about "xxx", I really need you to be on this call if possible. There will most likely be technical questions which I cannot answer and without you on the call it would be pointless. I hope you get this in time.

* Attached/Enclosed please find the report. I attached the report and let me know what you think.

* 本来你只是在cc列表里作为旁观者，但是你也想进来插一句话怎么说: Just to chime in,  xxxx / I'd like to chime in with my idea, xxxx

* As a side note, I'm beginning to think our current measurement method doesn't seem to be accurate enough.

* That being said, we still need to ...(话虽如此，我们还是需要...)

* This issue needs to be addressed.（这个问题需要引起注意并解决）

* When there is delivery issue, please involve the sales team.

* I want to be mindful of your time and we don’t have any updates at this point; therefore I suggest that we cancel/reschedule today's meeting. If you disagree or need assistance, please let us know. (取消会议)

* My apologies for the late notice, but i need to reschedule tomorrow's call. There remain a few open items we need to address, therefore i will send out a new invite once we agree upon a time.

* Once these final steps are finished, I would suggest having a brief call to discuss our findings and recommendations for next steps.  Would you please provide a few times the week of XXX that work within your schedule and I will send the calendar invite?

* Due to time constraints or time limit / Based on the level of information as of today / According to the oral information of XXX 免责声明

* Would it be okay if I come to your office hours this week to talk about this, and if not, would you be willing to schedule an appointment with me?
